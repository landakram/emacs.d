* Mark's Emacs Config 

This is my Emacs config. Peruse it if you wish -- it is highly personal and tweaked often.

A few things to note:

- [[home/.emacs.d/config.org][My configuration]] is implemented as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate]] [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][org]] document.
- As a recovering vim user, I use [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil][evil-mode]]. Maybe one day I will learn the default Emacs keybindings.
- I use [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] for completion. Previously, I used helm and then ivy. They both change the experience of using Emacs pretty significantly -- I think for the better. 
- I make some assumptions that I am running on OS X, but it loads and mostly works in a linux environment.

Emacs took me a really long time to get into. I started my journey with [[http://spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]], a fantastic Emacs starter kit that works well for vim users. After some time, I wanted to understand what was going on under the hood, and so I stopped using Spacemacs and made my own config.

Learning Emacs was/is hard work, but well worth it. Emacs has reshaped my understanding of what is possible with an editor, and I feel like I could use Emacs /for the rest of my life/.
